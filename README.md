# OrderHub
A simple, secure and scalable API for managing customer orders ‚Äî from creation to real-time status updates.

OrderHub is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma ORM, following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system enables buyers and sellers to efficiently manage and track orders through a scalable, maintainable, and intuitive architecture.

# Project Setup Guide

## üìã Requirements
Before running this project, make sure you have installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
---

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Start the Database


```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will spin up the PostgreSQL container required by the app.

### 2. Create a .env File

At the root of the project, create a .env file with the following content:

```
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/orderhub_db'
JWT_SECRET='something_like_your_super_secret_key'
PORT=3333
```

Notes: 
- Adjust the DATABASE_URL if your database credentials are different. 
- PORT is optional if you don't set it, default value will be 3333

### 3. Install Project Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Apply Database Migrations

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

This will apply migrations and generate the Prisma Client.

### 5. Running the Project


```bash
npm run dev
```

### 6. (Optional) Explore Your Database

You can use Prisma Studio to visualize and manage your database easily:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

Prisma Studio will open a browser window where you can explore your tables and records.



## ‚ùó Troubleshooting

**Migration Issues:**

If you encounter migration errors, you can reset the database:

```bash 
npx prisma migrate reset
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è This will delete all existing data in the database.**

## Future Improvements


**Integrate Frontend with React:** Implement a React frontend to make the project full-stack. This will involve creating an intuitive user interface where buyers can place and track orders, and sellers can manage and update order statuses.

**Real-time Order Updates:** Add WebSocket support for real-time order status updates, ensuring both buyers and sellers can see live updates on their orders.

**User Notifications:** Implement email or push notifications to inform users about the status of their orders, such as when an order is out for delivery or when there‚Äôs an issue with the order.
